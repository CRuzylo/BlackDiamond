Based off the SafeMoon fork, UltraSafe, Contract.
Removed key vulnerability in SafeMoon contract : 

 //Locks the contract for owner for the amount of time provided
    function lock(uint256 time) public virtual onlyOwner {
        _previousOwner = _owner;
        _owner = address(0);
        _lockTime = now + time;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(_owner, address(0));
    }
    
    //Unlocks the contract for owner when _lockTime is exceeds
    function unlock() public virtual {
        require(_previousOwner == msg.sender, "You don't have permission to unlock");
        require(now > _lockTime , "Contract is locked until 7 days");
        emit OwnershipTransferred(_owner, _previousOwner);
        _owner = _previousOwner;
    }
